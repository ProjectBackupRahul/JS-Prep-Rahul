AWS Lambda provides various configurations to optimize function performance, including setting the memory allocation. 
The memory setting affects not just the RAM but also the CPU power available to your function, which influences execution time and cost.

Here's a detailed overview of managing and understanding memory configuration for Lambda functions:

AWS Lambda Memory Configuration
Memory and CPU Relationship
Memory Allocation: Ranges from 128 MB to 10,240 MB (10 GB), in 1 MB increments.
CPU Allocation: CPU power scales linearly with memory. More memory means more CPU power, which can reduce execution time.
Configuring Memory Allocation
You can set or update the memory for a Lambda function using various methods: AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, AWS SDK, or AWS CDK.

Setting Memory Using AWS Management Console
Go to the Lambda Console: AWS Lambda Console.
Select Your Function: Click on the function you want to configure.
Edit Configuration: Under the Configuration tab, select General configuration.
Memory: Adjust the memory slider or enter the desired memory value.
Save: Click Save to apply the changes.
Setting Memory Using AWS CLI
To update memory using the AWS CLI:
