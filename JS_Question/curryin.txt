It is a technique in functional programming, transformation of the function
 of multiple arguments
into several functions of a single argument in sequence. 

The translation of function happens something like this,

<script>
	function calculateVolume(length) {
		return function (breadth) {
			return function (height) {
				return length * breadth * height;
			}
		}
	}
	console.log(calculateVolume(4)(5)(6));
</script>
