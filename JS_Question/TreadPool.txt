In Node, there are two types of threads: one Event Loop (aka the main loop, the main thread, event thread, etc.), 
and a pool of k Workers in a Worker Pool (aka the thread pool). 
The libuv library maintains a pool of threads that are used by node.js to perform long-running operations in the background, 
without blocking its main thread.

Example of Theard pool Lib: 

 npm libuv:
