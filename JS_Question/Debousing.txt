Debouncing is a programming pattern used to ensure that a function is executed only after a specified time has elapsed since the last time it was invoked. 
This is particularly useful for optimizing performance in scenarios where a function could be called frequently, such as during window resizing, scrolling, or keystrokes in a text input.

Key Concepts of Debouncing
Prevents Repeated Execution: Ensures a function isn't executed multiple times in quick succession.
Execution Delay: Delays the function execution until a specified time period has passed without the function being called again.
Optimization: Reduces the number of times the function is called, improving performance for high-frequency events.
Use Cases
Search Input: Updating search results as a user types, but only after they stop typing for a moment.
Window Resize: Triggering layout recalculations or redrawing only after the user has finished resizing the window.
Form Validation: Running validation only after a user has stopped typing.
Implementing Debouncing in JavaScript
Here's how to implement and use a debouncing function in JavaScript:

Basic Debounce Function
A basic debounce function takes two arguments: the function to debounce (func) and the delay in milliseconds (delay).

javascript
Copy code
function debounce(func, delay) {
    let timeoutId;
    return function(...args) {
        clearTimeout(timeoutId);
        timeoutId = setTimeout(() => func.apply(this, args), delay);
    };
}
Explanation:

clearTimeout(timeoutId): Clears any existing timeout to reset the delay period.
timeoutId = setTimeout(): Sets a new timeout to call func after delay milliseconds.
Usage Example
1. Debouncing a Search Input
