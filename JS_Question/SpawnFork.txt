This starts sending data back to a parent process from the child process as soon as the child process starts executing.

1.	This does not send data automatically, but we can use a global module name process to send data from the child process and 
    in the parent module, using the name of the child the process to send to the child process.

It creates a new process through command rather than running on the same node process.	
It makes several individual processes (child processes) but all of them run on the same node process as the parent.

In this, no new V8 instance is created.
In this, a new V8 instance is created.


It is used when we want the child process to return a large amount of data back to the parent process.	
It is used to separate computation-intensive tasks from the main event loop.
