There’s a special syntax to work with promises in a more comfortable fashion, called “async/await”.
 It’s surprisingly easy to understand and use.

 async function f() {

    let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000)
    });
  
    let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves (*)
  
    alert(result); // "done!"
  }
  
  f();

  (async () => {
    let response = await fetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json');
    let user = await response.json();
    
  })();
