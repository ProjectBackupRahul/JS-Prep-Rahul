Let us see the differences in a tabular form -:

process.nextTick()	setImmediate()
1.	process.nextTick() is used to schedule a callback function to be invoked in the next iteration of the Event Loop.
	setImmediate() method is used to execute a function right after the current event loop finishes.
2.	Its benefit is that it has no time bound to take a callback.	
setImmediate() method is only processed on the check handler phase of the event loop
3.	process.nextTick() function is specific to the Node.js Event Loop	
It is generally found in the Timers module
4.	
Its syntax is -:

process.nextTick(callback);

Its syntax is -:

setImmediate(callback);

5.	It has a benefit that it has the potential to cause I/O starvation
	Its return value is a unique timer identifier that can be used in another function call.
