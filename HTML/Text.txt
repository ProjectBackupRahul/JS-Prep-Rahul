           _self: this is the default value. It opens the document in the same window or tabs as it was clicked.
           _blank: It opends the document in a new window or tab.
           _parent: It open the document in parant frame.
           _top: It opens the document in a full-body window.

       There are basically three ways to specify the CSS
       Inline: Here we use the <style> Attribute inside the element

       Internal: here we use the <style> tag inside the <head> Tag

       External: Here we use the <link> tag inside <head> to reference the CSS file into our HTML code. Again the binding 
        between elements and styles is doing using 'id' or 'class' attributes.

        Q7. Inline and Block Element: 

          Inline elements just takes up the space taht is absolutely necessary.

           Ex: <span> <a> <strong> <img> <button> <em> <select> <abbr> <label> <sub> etc.

           Block elements start on a new line and consume the full width of the page available
           Example : <div> <p> <header> <footer> <h1> <h6> <from> <table> <cavas> <video> <blockquote> <pre> <ul> <ol> <figcaption> <figcaption> <figcaption>
