Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, and Grid for two-dimensional layouts.

The approach of CSS Grid is the layout first, while the Flexbox approach is primarily the content.

The Flexbox layout is best suited to application components and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is designed for 

larger-scale layouts that are not linear in design.
